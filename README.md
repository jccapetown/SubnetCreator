# SubnetCreator
Enter the IP range you would like to use (Class A, B, C) eg 10.0.0.1/8 and then select how to break the nework up on network mask eg /17. It will then produce all subnets with the total amount of hosts per subnet blocks with first and last usable IP including the Network address and Broadcast Address.
